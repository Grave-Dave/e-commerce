# 🧭 How to Preview the App

Hi! 👋  
Thanks for taking the time to look at my fullstack project. Below are simple steps to launch and preview the app.

## ⚙️ About the Project

This is a fullstack web application built with:

- **Backend:** [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) (Node.js framework)
- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React framework)

Both are hosted on **free Render.com** servers. These free-tier servers can "go to sleep" when not used, so it may take **up to 1–2 minutes** to wake them up.

---

## 🛠️ How to Launch the App

Because the frontend depends on the backend being awake first, please follow these steps in order:

### 1. Start the Backend
👉 [Click here to wake up the backend](https://e-commerce-be-plc7.onrender.com/)  
Wait around **30–60 seconds** until it’s fully up and running.

### 2. Start the Frontend
👉 [Click here to open the app](https://e-commerce-fe-wh7z.onrender.com/)  
If you see an error at first, just wait a bit and **refresh the page**.

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

- Seeing errors? The backend might still be starting up. Refresh the frontend after a minute.
- If something doesn’t work, feel free to contact me — I’d love to help or give a short walkthrough.
