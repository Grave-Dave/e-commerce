# 🧭 How to Preview the App

## 🟢 TL;DR

- This is a fullstack app (NestJS + Next.js) hosted for free on Render.com
- Free hosting means **servers go to sleep** when not used
- To preview the app:
    1. 👉 **[Start the backend](https://e-commerce-be-plc7.onrender.com/)** (wait ~30–60 seconds)
    2. 👉 **[Open the frontend](https://e-commerce-fe-wh7z.onrender.com/)** (refresh if needed)

## ⚙️ About the Project

This is a fullstack web application built with:

- **Backend:** [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) (Node.js framework)
- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React framework)

Both are hosted on **free Render.com** servers. These servers go to sleep when inactive, so they may take **up to 1–2 minutes** to wake up.

## 🛠️ How to Launch the App

Because the frontend needs the backend to be running first, please follow these steps in order:

### 1. Start the Backend
👉 [Click here to wake up the backend](https://e-commerce-be-plc7.onrender.com/)  
Wait around **30–60 seconds** until it’s fully running.

### 2. Start the Frontend
👉 [Click here to open the app](https://e-commerce-fe-wh7z.onrender.com/)  
If you see an error at first, just wait a bit and **refresh the page**.

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

- **App not loading?** The backend might still be waking up. Refresh the frontend after a minute.
- **Still not working?** Feel free to reach out — I’m happy to help or walk you through the project.
